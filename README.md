# agentic-workflow-test

Repository for testing chaining of agents and handovers

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete agent workflow system with four specialized **custom GitHub Copilot agents** that work together in a coordinated pipeline:

**develop → test → document → review**

Each agent is a custom agent definition stored in `.github/agents/` that can be invoked through the GitHub Copilot agent system. Each agent is independent and specialized for a specific task, allowing for a robust, iterative development workflow.

## Agent Workflow

### The Four Agents

1. **[Develop Agent](.github/agents/develop-agent.md)** - Implements features and writes code
2. **[Test Agent](.github/agents/test-agent.md)** - Tests implementations independently  
3. **[Document Agent](.github/agents/document-agent.md)** - Creates comprehensive documentation
4. **[Review Agent](.github/agents/review-agent.md)** - Reviews all work and provides feedback

### Workflow Process

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Request   │
└──────┬──────┘

## Quick Start

### Using Custom Agent Handovers

Simply start with this prompt, do not save it in a prompt-file, could not make that work (yet)
```
@develop-agent Task: {Your special task to be used}
- Remember to follow the orchestration workflow as described in the repository
- Run subagents for each phase
```

These agents are **custom GitHub Copilot agents** defined in `.github/agents/`. Orchestrate the workflow by invoking these custom agents through GitHub Copilot's agent system, having each agent hand off to the next in sequence:

```
Invoke custom agent: develop-agent to implement [your feature]
  ↓ (develops code)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: test-agent to test the implementation
  ↓ (tests code)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: document-agent to document the feature
  ↓ (creates docs)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: review-agent to review all work
  ↓ (approves or requests changes)
```

Each custom agent:
1. Is invoked through GitHub Copilot's custom agent system
2. Completes its specialized task
3. Provides context and artifacts for the next agent

**Note**: These are custom agent definitions, not standard GitHub @mentions. They must be invoked through GitHub Copilot, not directly in issues or PRs.

See [Workflow Orchestrator](.github/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md) for detailed handover examples.

## Documentation

- **[Workflow Orchestrator](.github/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md)** - How to chain agents together
- **[Workflow Example](.github/agents/workflow-example.md)** - Complete example walkthrough
- **[Individual Agent Definitions](.github/agents/)** - Detailed agent specifications

## Agent Characteristics

### Independence
Each agent works independently without assuming the previous agent's context or perspective.

### Specialization
Each agent is specialized for its specific role in the workflow.

### Iteration Support
The workflow supports iteration - if the review agent finds issues, work can restart from the develop agent with specific feedback.

### Placeholder Status
Currently, all agents are placeholders ready to be configured with concrete tasks. The framework is in place for:
- Adding specific development tasks
- Defining testing frameworks
- Establishing documentation standards
- Setting review criteria

## Demo Project: Calculator Module

This repository includes a complete working example - a Python calculator module - that demonstrates the full agent workflow in action:

- **Implementation** (by develop-agent): A well-structured calculator module in `src/calculator.py` with 5 functions
- **Testing** (by test-agent): Comprehensive test suite with 45 tests and 100% coverage
- **Documentation** (by document-agent): Complete documentation in `CALCULATOR.md`

📖 **See [CALCULATOR.md](CALCULATOR.md) for full calculator documentation**

### Quick Calculator Example

```python
from src.calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide, calculate

# Basic operations
add(10, 5)          # Returns: 15
subtract(10, 5)     # Returns: 5
multiply(10, 5)     # Returns: 50
divide(10, 5)       # Returns: 2.0

# Unified interface
calculate('add', 10, 5)  # Returns: 15
```

## Features

✓ Four specialized agents with clear roles
✓ Agent handover orchestration with explicit @mentions
✓ Independent agent operation
✓ Review feedback loop for iterations
✓ Comprehensive documentation
✓ Example workflow demonstration (Calculator Module)
✓ Extensible architecture

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Contributing

When adding concrete tasks to agents:
1. Update the relevant agent definition in `.github/agents/`
2. Maintain the independence of each agent
3. Ensure clear handoff protocols
4. Update documentation accordingly
