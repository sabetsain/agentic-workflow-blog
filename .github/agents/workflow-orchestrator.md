# Agent Workflow Orchestrator

This document describes how to chain the custom GitHub Copilot agents together to create a complete development workflow.

## What Are These Agents?

These are **custom GitHub Copilot agent definitions** stored in `.github/agents/`. They are NOT standard GitHub @mentions that work in issues or PRs. Instead, they are specialized agent prompts that can be invoked through GitHub Copilot's custom agent system.

## Workflow Overview

The agent workflow follows this sequence:

```
[Task Request] → develop-agent → test-agent → document-agent → review-agent → [Complete/Restart]
```

## Agent Chain Description

### 1. Develop Agent (develop-agent.md)
**Input**: Feature request or task description
**Output**: Implemented code and list of changes
**Next**: test-agent

### 2. Test Agent (test-agent.md)
**Input**: Code from develop-agent
**Output**: Test results and validation report
**Next**: document-agent

### 3. Document Agent (document-agent.md)
**Input**: Code and test results
**Output**: Updated documentation
**Next**: review-agent

### 4. Review Agent (review-agent.md)
**Input**: All artifacts from previous agents
**Output**: Final approval or change requests
**Next**: Complete or restart from develop-agent

## How to Use the Workflow

### Agent Handover Orchestration

The workflow is orchestrated through **custom agent handovers** within the GitHub Copilot agent system. These are custom agents defined in `.github/agents/` that can be invoked through GitHub Copilot.

**How it works**: These agents are custom GitHub Copilot agents (not standard GitHub @mentions). When working with GitHub Copilot, you invoke each custom agent in sequence. Each agent completes its specialized task and provides output that informs the next agent in the workflow. The handoff happens by explicitly invoking the next agent with the context from the previous agent's work.

**Important**: These `@agent-name` references in the examples below represent custom GitHub Copilot agents defined in this repository's `.github/agents/` directory. They are invoked through the GitHub Copilot custom agent system, not through standard GitHub issue/PR mentions.

#### Step 1: Invoke develop-agent
```
@develop-agent please implement [feature description]

Context: New feature request
Requirements: [detailed requirements]
```

The develop-agent will:
- Implement the requested feature
- Document what was changed
- Hand off to test-agent with a summary

#### Step 2: develop-agent hands off to test-agent
The develop-agent completes with:
```
@test-agent please test the implementation

Context: Implemented [feature] in the following files:
- src/feature.js
- lib/utils.js

Changes made:
- Added feature X with methods A, B, C
- Updated utility Y to support Z

Please verify: [test scenarios]
```

#### Step 3: test-agent hands off to document-agent
The test-agent completes with:
```
@document-agent please document the feature

Context: Testing complete for [feature]

Test Results:
- 15/15 tests passed (100%)
- Coverage: 95%
- All edge cases validated

Please document:
- Feature X API and usage
- Methods A, B, C specifications
- Known limitations: [if any]
```

#### Step 4: document-agent hands off to review-agent
The document-agent completes with:
```
@review-agent please review the complete workflow

Context: Documentation complete for [feature]

Documentation created:
- API reference in docs/api.md
- Usage examples in examples/usage.js
- Updated README.md

All artifacts ready for review:
- Code implementation (develop-agent)
- Test results (test-agent)
- Documentation (document-agent)
```

#### Step 5: review-agent completes or restarts workflow
The review-agent either:

**APPROVED**:
```
STATUS: ✓ APPROVED

Quality Assessment:
- Code: Excellent
- Tests: Very Good
- Documentation: Excellent

Workflow complete. Ready for merge.
```

**CHANGES REQUESTED**:
```
STATUS: ⚠ CHANGES REQUESTED

@develop-agent please address the following:

Issues found:
1. Missing input validation for parameter X
2. Edge case not handled: [specific case]

Priority: High
Please reimplement and restart workflow.
```

## Workflow States

### Success Path
```
develop → test → document → review → APPROVED → COMPLETE
```

### Iteration Path
```
develop → test → document → review → CHANGES REQUESTED → develop (with feedback)
```

## Context Passing

Each agent should receive:
- **Task**: What they need to accomplish
- **Previous Context**: Summary from previous agents
- **Artifacts**: Relevant files, code, or results

Format for context passing:
```
## Previous Agent Output
[Summary from previous agent]

## Artifacts
- File: path/to/file.ext
- Changes: description of changes
- Results: test results or other outputs

## Your Task
[Specific instructions for current agent]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Communication**: Each agent should provide clear output for the next agent
2. **Independent Operation**: Agents should work independently without assuming previous agent's perspective
3. **Comprehensive Output**: Include all relevant information in handoff
4. **Iteration Ready**: Support workflow restarts based on review feedback

## Example Workflow Session

See `workflow-example.md` for a complete example of the workflow in action.

## Future Enhancements

- Automated agent chaining via CI/CD
- Workflow state persistence
- Metrics and analytics collection
- Parallel agent execution for independent tasks
- Custom workflow branching logic
